## Symposium
This Symposium on Data Protection and Cybersecurity in Humanitarian Action brings together experts from the public, private and humanitarian sectors, as well as academia and civil society, to reflect on and offer solutions to key legal, strategic and operational issues that humanitarian organizations face as a consequence of the digital transformation.

## Digital Humanitarian Community
The Digital Humanitarian Community works to define the concept of cyber-volunteering in order to deliver a set of Neutral, Impartial and Independent Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) for the humanitarian community via an inclusive partnership framework with National Societies, tech companies, universities, think tanks, and other relevant stakeholders while ensuring their security through the support of the white hat hacking community.

## Delegation for Cyberspace
The ICRC Delegation for Cyberspace, based in Luxembourg, aims to test technology relevant for the deployment of services to people affected by armed conflict and other situations of violence by digital means, in a neutral, impartial, and independent manner. It also aims to explore how to adapt the ICRC's way of working, as well as the work of the International Movement of the Red Cross and Red Crescent and the wider humanitarian community, for the benefit of people affected by humanitarian emergencies globally.

## ICRC
The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) is an impartial, neutral and independent organization whose exclusively humanitarian mission is to protect the lives and dignity of victims of armed conflict and other situations of violence and to provide them with assistance.
The ICRC also endeavours to prevent suffering by promoting and strengthening humanitarian law and universal humanitarian principles.
Established in 1863, the ICRC is at the origin of the Geneva Conventions and the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement. It directs and coordinates the international activities conducted by the Movement in armed conflicts and other situations of violence.
